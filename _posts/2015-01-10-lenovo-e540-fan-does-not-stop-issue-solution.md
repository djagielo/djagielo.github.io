Last year(June) I bought new laptop for me - it was Lenovo e540 with core i7. But all the time I had problem (like others Lenovo e540 users) with fan noise. When it started to spin once i was not going to stop even if computer was IDLE. Suspending computer was solution only for couple of seconds after laptop up.

Half a year I was looking for BIOS updates - there were 4 or 5 versions and finally the newest version is the solution. After installing version 2.17 I think it's working better - yeah fan is turning off again when IDLE :)

#### Bios update tool
You can download BIOS update tool from official Lenovo website <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds037207">http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds037207</a>

#### Shame Lenovo, shame...
It's a shame for Lenovo that it took so long to modify thermal tables and for half a year I was really angry but finally we have solution :)
