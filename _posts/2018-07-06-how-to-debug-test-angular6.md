I was writing about the similiar problem in case of Angular v4 in the post named **How to debug 'NetworkError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'XMLHttpRequest'' in Karma tests**.
With Angular v6 error message is little different but still does not provide useful message. With Angular v6 a solution of this problems is also slightly different.

#### Solution
The Solution is quite simple - the same I was writing about couple of months ago. We need to turn off source maps flag. Before, it could be done by adding **_--sourcemaps=false_** parameter, but now we need to use:
<pre>
<code class="language-bash">
ng test --sourceMap=false
</code>
</pre>

Next thing that surprised me was absence of CLI parameter **_--singleRun_**. Now we should use:

<pre>
<code class="language-bash">
ng test --watch=false
</code>
</pre>
