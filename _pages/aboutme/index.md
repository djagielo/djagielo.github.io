#### Experience
Software Developer with ~5 years experience. In the past focused on Java/Java EE ecosystem - heavy-weight, full-stack with JSF Icefaces/Primefaces.
For over a year I'm interested in lighter, micro-service backend, powered by Spring Boot. Now I'm developing myself to become full-stack again, with Angular on UI-side.
#### Motivation
My blog is a kind of a personal notepad. I'll use it to note problems which I faced during my every day work. I also use it as a way to review my knowledge - to fully learn the topic we need to learn basics, do practical exercises, learn again and finally teach someone else. Only then you can consider your knowledge as well-established.
